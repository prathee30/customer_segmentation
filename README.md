E-commerce customer segmentation

The spirit of modern era is innovation, where everyone is embroiled to compete with others. Todayâ€™s businesses are being run on the basis of such innovation having ability to enthral the customers with the products, but with such a large raft of products the companies are nonplussed about which section of customers to target to sell their products. Machine learning plays a major role in identifying which segment to target, by applying customer segmentation techniques. The main objective of this research is to segment the customers into different segments based on the customer behaviour pattern. Clustering has been proven effective in implementing this. The outcome of this system provides an in-depth analysis of each cluster with enhanced visualizations. The proposed system can also be used to segment the customers of various business sectors. This research work also describes how customers drift between clusters, enabling practitioners to increase customer loyalty and long-term profitability
